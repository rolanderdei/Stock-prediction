# Stock prediction - Autoregression, ARIMA, LSTM (made in 2021)

*Stock (also capital stock) of a corporation is all of the shares into which ownership of the corporation is divided. In American English, the shares are collectively known as "stock". A single share of the stock represents fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares.*

The data set includes information about:
- Date 
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close

These notebooks focus on exploring and predicting stocks using different methods.

There are 2 Jupyter notebooks:
1. Testing and implementing the algorithms
2. An easy to use notebook, only change one line of code to get insight and prediction for another stock

Contains: EDA, AR, ARIMA, LSTM
